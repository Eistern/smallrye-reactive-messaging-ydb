== Customizing the underlying AMQP client

You can customize the underlying AMQP Client configuration by _producing_ an instance of https://vertx.io/docs/apidocs/io/vertx/amqp/AmqpClientOptions.html[`AmqpClientOptions`]:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$customization/ClientProducers.java[tag=named]
----
This instance is retrieved and used to configure the client used by the connector.
You need to indicate the name of the client using the `client-options-name` attribute:

[source]
----
mp.messaging.incoming.prices.client-options-name=my-named-options
----

=== Client capabilities

Both incoming and outgoing AMQP channels can be configured with a list of capabilities to declare during sender and receiver connections with the AMQP broker. Note that supported capability names are broker specific.

mp.messaging.incoming.sink.capabilities=temporary-topic
...
mp.messaging.outgoing.source.capabilities=shared
