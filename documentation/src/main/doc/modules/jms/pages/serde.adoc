[#jms-serde]
== Serde choice

For payload serde, JMS Connector uses JSON as format.

JMS Connector supports any serde implementing `JsonMapping`.

Smallrye comes with 2 implementations out-of-the-box. To avoid confusion, the preferred one has a lower priority (see `JsonMapping#DEFAULT_PRIORITY`)

=== Jackson

Jackson implementation is the preferred one with the default priority.

To include it, add the dependency on `io.smallrye.reactive:smallrye-reactive-messaging-jackson` to your project.

=== JSON-B

JSON-B (based on Yasson) is the alternative with a higher priority (will be overruled by any implementation with smaller priority). Therefore if accidentally multiple serde implementations are included only the one with the lower priority should be used.

To include it, add the dependency on `io.smallrye.reactive:smallrye-reactive-messaging-jsonb` to your project.

=== Custom

To use a custom JSON serde, simply provide own implementation of `JsonMapping` within the CDI scope
