= RabbitMQ

The RabbitMQ Connector adds support for RabbitMQ to Reactive Messaging, based on the AMQP 0-9-1 Protocol Specification.

Advanced Message Queuing Protocol 0-9-1 (https://www.rabbitmq.com/resources/specs/amqp0-9-1.pdf[AMQP 0-9-1]) is an open standard for passing business messages between applications or organizations.

With this connector, your application can:

* receive messages from a RabbitMQ queue
* send messages to a RabbitMQ exchange

The RabbitMQ connector is based on the https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-rabbitmq-client/java/[Vert.x RabbitMQ Client].

[IMPORTANT]
====
The *AMQP connector* supports the AMQP 1.0 protocol, which is very different from AMQP 0-9-1. You _can_ use the AMQP connector with RabbitMQ provided that the latter has the https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-amqp1.0/blob/v3.7.x/README.md[AMQP 1.0 Plugin] installed, albeit with reduced functionality.
